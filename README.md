# ILI9341-STM32-LL-library
This is a ILI9341 STM32 LL library

This library is not customizable because I didn't have time, SPI1 is used to communicate with the display, the pins must be named in CUBEMX with the same label present in the library to work. Any help when standardizing the library will be welcome.
